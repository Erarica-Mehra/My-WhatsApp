I built this whatsapp clone with React and Firebase. This application is not intended for commercial purposes. The main aim was to build a full fledged application in React from scratch.

# Getting Started with Create React App
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App]. 

## Technology Stack
1. React
2. Firebase Firestore Realtime DB
3. Material UI
4. React Router
5. React Context API
6. Redux
7. Google Authentication
8. Deploy using Firebase

## Main Features
1. Sign-In with Google Authentication
2. Add new Chat Rooms
3. View Existing chats
4. View Last Seen of other chat members

## References
1. https://console.firebase.google.com
2. https://material-ui.com/components
3. https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in the browser.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
Your app is ready to be deployed!
